# RubAI

RubAI is the simplest coding agent that can be created. It is a minimal Ruby project for learning and experimentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) using the RubyLLM gem and Ollama. This repository is not intended for production use, but rather as a playground to explore how to connect Ruby applications to AI APIs and handle responses.

## Purpose
This project serves as a hands-on introduction to integrating Ruby with LLM services. It demonstrates basic usage patterns, error handling, and configuration, making it a useful reference for anyone interested in experimenting with AI in Ruby.

## Features
- Connects to LLM APIs via RubyLLM and Ollama
- Basic error handling for API responses
- Simple, readable code structure

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	bundle install
	```
2. Update the configuration section in `main.rb` with your preferences.
3. Run the main script:
	```sh
	ruby main.rb
	```

## Project Structure
- `main.rb`: Main script for interacting with the LLM
- `Gemfile`: Gem dependencies
- `sorbet/`: Sorbet type definitions and RBI files
- `bin/`: Executable scripts

## Disclaimer
This is a learning project. The code is experimental and may not follow best practices for production applications.
